    <h1> Description </h1>
    <p> During the summer, I had to work, go out with friends, and eat. I had to go to work full time at the office,
        from 8 am to 5 pm. The weekends are the only time I had to go out with friends. I also enjoyed eating during the
        summer. My favorite foods to eat during the summer were fruit, ice cream, and cold noodles. </p>
